## Practice Statement: Fencing a Barn


**Ron wishes to renovate his barn. He thinks that creating fences and keeping the animals 
separately would help him feed the animals easily and also solve the problem of animals
getting mixed. For this, he plans to divide the area into three parts. He will create a 
square area for the chickens, a circular area for the ducks and a rectangular area for
the cows.**

    Create a program in Java to help Ron calculate the area for each fence separately.
    Note: Input ‘side’ for the square, ‘length and breadth’ for rectangle and ‘radius’ 
    for circle.

Hint- Use Switch case
